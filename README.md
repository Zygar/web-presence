# Andy's Web Presence

A place for me...

- say what I'm all about.
- hold my skills, work background and achievements.
- showcase my projects and solicit new opportunities
- hone my design/development skills and play with new techniques.


## Areas I'd like to play with / learn

- Structured, open data/microformats for things like...
  - contact details and breadcrumbs. (Google)
  - Social Media descriptors for main pages and more importantly projects (Twitter, FB)
- Good conventions for structuring and documenting CSS. 
  - Try out BEM / OOCSS—maybe SCSS. 
- Some React or Angular-based modules. I'd love to have...
  - A basic habit-tracker (that only I can use)
  - A project activity tracker: I can dump in all my "main" projects and tap them every time I work on them.


## Things I would like to feature on it:

- Projects / Work
  - Slow Burners / Research Interests (e.g. Mental health, spread of ideas/polarisation, creating serendipitous environments)
  - Concrete gigs (Twingl, Trailblazer, Clap, Arges, Ethixxx)
  - Anchor project / "looking for work"
  - Talks/recordings of talks
  - Canonical blog posts (that syndicate to Medium)
- Elevator Pitch / "About Me"
