# Andy's Web Presence

A place for me...

- say what I'm all about.
- hold my skills, work background and achievements.
- showcase my projects and solicit new opportunities
- hone my design/development skills and play with new techniques.


## Areas I'd like to play with / learn

- Structured, open data/microformats for things like...
  - contact details and breadcrumbs. (Google)
  - Social Media descriptors for main pages and more importantly projects (Twitter, FB)
- Good conventions for structuring and documenting CSS.
